# fbuervenich - personal CV generator

A react app I built to automatically generate my CV localized without having to maintain different files, fed with the same data as my [personal portfolio website](https://github.com/FBuervenich/fbuervenich-portfolio).


### How to use

* Install deps: `yarn install`
* Add an environment file `.env.local` (see `.env` for format)
* Run app: `yarn start`
* Print as pdf to generate the PDF-export


### Result (blurred for privacy reasons)

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
